This is to protect people around you if you are infected but do not have symptoms.	When do you need to wear a cloth face covering?	A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people are in a community setting, especially in situations where you may be near people.  These settings include grocery stores and pharmacies.  These face coverings are not a substitute for social distancing.  Cloth face coverings are especially important to wear in public in areas of widespread COVID-19 illness.	Do I still need to stay at least 6 feet away from people if wearing a cloth face covering?	Yes.  Wearing cloth face coverings is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19.  CDC still recommends that you stay at least 6 feet away from other people ),frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.  A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but it may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.  This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
