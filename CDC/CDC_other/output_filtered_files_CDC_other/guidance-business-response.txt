	Older adults and people who have severe underlying chronic medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness.	Find more information here.	Summary of Changes to the Guidance:	This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about the coronavirus disease 2019.  )COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person.  The outbreak first started in China, but the virus continues to spread internationally and in the United States.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention )will update this interim guidance as additional information becomes available.	The following interim guidance may help prevent workplace exposures to COVID-19, in non-healthcare settings.  )This guidance also provides planning considerations for community spread of COVID-19.	To prevent stigma and discrimination in the workplace, use only the guidance described below to determine risk of COVID-19 infection.  Do not make determinations of risk based on race or country of origin and be sure to maintain confidentiality of people with confirmed coronavirus infection.  There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features of COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.  Updates are available on CDC's web page.	Businesses and employers can prevent and slow the spread of COVID-19.  Employers should plan to respond in a flexible way to varying levels of disease transmission in the community and be prepared to refine their business response plans as needed.  According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ),most American workers will likely experience low )or medium exposure risk levels at their job or place of employment.	)Businesses are strongly encouraged to coordinate with state and local health officials so timely and accurate information can guide appropriate responses.  Local conditions will influence the decisions that public health officials make regarding community-level strategies.  CDC has guidance for mitigation strategies according to the level of community transmission or impact of COVID-19.	All employers need to consider how best to decrease the spread of COVID-19 and lower the impact in their workplace.  This may include activities in one or more of the following areas:	Actively encourage sick employees to stay home:	Employees who have symptoms )should notify their supervisor and stay home.	Sick employees should follow CDC-recommended steps.  Employees should not return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met, in consultation with healthcare providers and state and local health departments.	Employees who are well but who have a sick family member at home with COVID-19 should notify their supervisor and follow CDC recommended precautions.	Identify where and how workers might be exposed to COVID-19 at work:	See OSHA COVID-19 webpage for more information on how to protect workers from potential exposures and guidance for employers, including steps to take for jobs according to exposure risk.	Be aware that some employees may be at higher risk for serious illness, such as older adults and those with chronic medical conditions.  Consider minimizing face-to-face contact between these employees or assign work tasks that allow them to maintain a distance of six feet from other workers, customers and visitors, or to telework if possible.	Separate sick employees:	Employees who appear to have symptoms )upon arrival at work or who become sick during the day should immediately be separated from other employees, customers, and visitors and sent home.	If an employee is confirmed to have COVID-19 infection, employers should inform fellow employees of their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace but maintain confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act.  )The fellow employees should then self-monitor for symptoms.	)Educate employees about how they can reduce the spread of COVID-19:	Employees can take steps to protect themselves at work and at home.
