	You are in home quarantine because you are well but have been in close contact with a person with COVID-19 or have been travelling abroad.Home quarantine is intended for people without symptoms of COVID-19 but who have been in close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 or people who have been abroad during the last 14 days.You may leave your home but it is recommended to avoid close contact with others.	It is important that you are alert for symptoms of respiratory infection.  If you develop symptoms, isolate yourself at home until at least one day after the symptoms are gone.  If you need medical attention, contact your doctor by telephone and say that you are in home quarantine.	These rules apply for home quarantine:As a rule, you should not visit public places like shops and cafes.  If there is no alternative, you may go out to carry out a necessary errand to the shop or pharmacy, but ensure that you maintain distance )from other people and avoid queues.	You can go for a walk, but keep a distance of at least 1 to 2 metres from others.	Anyone who lives with someone who is in home quarantine, and who is not defined as a close contact, is not in home quarantine but should monitor their own symptoms, like the rest of the population.	If close contacts do not have symptoms, they are assumed to pose a low risk for further transmission.  It is therefore not necessary for you and household members to follow special advice for protection beyond good hand hygiene and other basic infection control measures.  Good hand hygiene with frequent hand washing with soap and water is recommended, particularly after using the toilet and before meals.		Close contacts must be in home quarantine for 14 days after the last contact with someone who is confirmed to have the virus.	Household members of people isolated with confirmed COVID-19 must be in home quarantine until isolation of the patient ends, or a minimum og 14 days after quarantine started.	People who have travelled outside Norway shall be in home quarantine for 14 days after their arrival in Norway.	Time in quarantine is not shortened with a negative test result.	If you have confirmed COVID-19, follow the advice for home isolation:
