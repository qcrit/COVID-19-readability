Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.  State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.  While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.

In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected.	For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness.
