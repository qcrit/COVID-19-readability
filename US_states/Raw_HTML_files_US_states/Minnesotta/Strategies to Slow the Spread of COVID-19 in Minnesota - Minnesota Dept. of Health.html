<h1>Strategies to Slow the Spread of COVID-19 in Minnesota</h1>
<p><span class="small">Updated on March 26, 2020</span></p>

<h2>Stay at Home order</h2>
<p>To protect the public's health and slow the rate of transmission of COVID-19, Governor Walz issued an executive order directing Minnesotans to stay at home and limit movements outside of their home beyond essential needs. This order takes effect at  11:59 p.m. on Friday, March 27 and ends at 5 p.m. on Friday, April 10. The Governor’s two-week order to stay home is forecasted to help slow the spread of COVID-19 and allow the state to make key preparations for the pandemic. These preparations include building hospital capacity, increasing access to life-saving equipment like ventilators, increasing testing, planning for how to care for vulnerable populations, and assessing public health data to determine which community mitigation strategies are most effective. </p>
<h3>Essential need activities</h3>
<p>Minnesotans may leave their homes only to perform any of the following activities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Health and safety activities, such as obtaining emergency services or medical supplies.</li>

  <li>Obtain necessary supplies and services, such as getting groceries, gasoline, or carry-out. </li>
  <li>Essential and interstate travel, such as returning to a home from outside this state. </li>
  <li>Care of others, such as caring for a family member, friend, or pet in another household. </li>
  <li>Displacement, such as moving between emergency shelters if you <br>
    are without a home.</li>
  <li> Relocation to ensure safety, such as relocating to a diﬀerent location if your home becomes unsafe due to domestic violence, sanitation, or essential operations reasons.</li>
  <li>Tribal activities and lands, such as activities by members within the boundaries of their tribal reservation.  </li>
  </ul>
<p>While doing these things you should practice social distancing (keep 6 feet apart from other people as much as possible).</p>
