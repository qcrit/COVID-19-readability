	I was tested for coronavirus (COVID-19).  How long until my test results will be available?	Contact your health care provider for your test results.  Results will usually be available in 24-48 hours, but may vary depending on a variety of factors (e.g, the time required to get the specimen to the lab, number of specimens that need to be tested, lab being used to do the testing).  The North Dakota Department of Health is unable to release results to patients.	The North Dakota Department of Health has developed a fact sheet for people who have been tested for COVID-19 and are waiting for results.	YOU ARE BEING TESTED FOR COVID-19, NOW WHAT?	As a person being tested for or possibly with COVID-19, please follow the steps below to help prevent the disease from spreading to people in your home and community.	As a person being tested for or possibly with COVID-19, please follow the steps below to help prevent the disease from spreading to people in your home and community.  ISOLATE People who are mildly ill with or suspected to have COVID-19 should isolate at home during the course of the illness.  Activities outside the home should be restricted.  Do not attend work, school or spend time in public areas.  Do not use public transportation, ride-sharing or taxis.	Separate yourself from the people and animals you live with in your home as much as possible which includes using a separate bathroom if available.  If total separation is not possible, avoid close contact with people and pets.  Do not snuggle, kiss or share food or drink and remember to wash your hands often.  Avoid sharing dishes, cups, utensils, towels, bedding and other personal items in the home until they can be washed with soap and water.  Clean all high-touch surfaces (counters, tabletops, doorknobs, toilets, phones, etc) at least daily if not more often.  Utilize household cleaning sprays and wipes according to the label instructions.  Facemasks can be worn when around other people or pets.  If you are not able to wear a facemask, then others may wear a facemask only when entering your isolated space.	Household contacts of people who are being tested for COVID-19 should remain at home until the test results are available.	For more information about your household contacts, see Recommended precautions for household members, intimate partners, and caregivers in a nonhealthcare setting.	Cover your mouth and nose with a disposable tissue when you cough or sneeze.  Throw these tissues into a lined trash can and immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.  If soap and water are not available, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.  Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth as much as possible.	If in the course of your illness you experience worsening or severe symptoms, it is important to seek medical care.  BEFORE SEEKING CARE, call ahead to the clinic or hospital where you plan to go and tell them you are being evaluated for or have been diagnosed with COVID-19 as they will have facility specific instructions.  The facility may have a separate door or process for intake for COVID-19 patients that will help to reduce the risk of infecting others.	If you have a medical emergency, call 911 and inform the dispatch personnel that you have or are being evaluated for COVID-19.  If possible, put on a facemask before EMS arrives.	If your test results indicate that you DO have COVID-19, remain in home isolation until the risk of secondary transmission is low.  You must remain at home isolated until 7 days have passed since your symptom onset AND you have been fever-free (<100.4F) for 72 hours without the use of fever-reducing medications AND respiratory symptoms are improving.	If your test results indicate that you DO NOT have COVID-19, you should still remain in home isolation until fever free without the use of fever-reducing medications for at least 24 hours and have improved illness signs or symptoms.	Where should I go to get tested for coronavirus (COVID-19)?	Individuals who think they may have COVID-19 but have minor symptoms should self-isolate at home.  Individuals seeking medical attention should call before they go in.  Symptoms of COVID-19 in people who have been exposed can include fever, cough and shortness of breath.  The symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after exposure.  Reported illnesses have ranged from people with little to no symptoms to people being severely ill and dying.	Each facility within the state is making decisions on how to see patients who require COVID-19 testing.  Some of those plans may include drive-through testing locations.  Talk with your health care providers in your community to determine how and where they are receiving patients for testing.	Not everyone calling a health care provider will be given guidance to come in for testing.  To address the shortage of nylon swabs, the North Dakota Department of Health has recommended to health care providers that testing be prioritized for the following groups:	Patients hospitalized with respiratory illness Those living or working in congregate settings Health care workers Those who are identified by public health as a close contact to an existing positive case and are ill All people should continue to follow social distancing guidance, good handwashing hygiene and staying home if sick.  Any person with a fever and/or respiratory symptoms who was not tested, should stay home until at least 3 days (72 hours) have passed since recovery (fever-free without the use of fever-reducing medications) and improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g, cough, shortness of breath); and at least 7 days have passed since symptoms first appeared.	My health care provider told me to call the North Dakota Department of Health's Public Health Hotline about getting tested for coronavirus (COVID-19)?	The North Dakota Department of Health has authorized providers to use their judgement on who should be tested for COVID-19.  Contact a health care provider; they will determine if you need to be tested for COVID-19.	The North Dakota Department of Health has provided the following guidance to health care providers: Health care providers should not refer patients to the North Dakota Department of Health for medical consultation or screening to determine the need for testing.	Other people in my family are being tested for coronavirus (COVID-19).  Should I be staying home?	People being tested and waiting for results should stay home until they receive their test results.	Healthy people who have been in contact with someone, including family members who are being tested and waiting for their results, can work and do not need to be quarantined at this time.  If someone in the household has tested positive for coronavirus, keep the entire household at home.	I may have been at the same location as a person who was diagnosed with coronavirus (COVID-19).  What should I do?	The North Dakota Department of Health will be conducting interviews with people that have been confirmed to have COVID-19 to determine who their close contacts are.	Being in an indoor environment (e.g, store, workplace, restaurant) with someone who has COVID-19 is not necessarily considered having close contact.  A close contact is defined as a person who spends a prolonged period of time within 6 feet (2 meters) of a person that has been diagnosed with COVID-19.  Close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with someone that has been diagnosed with COVID-19.  Just being in an indoor environment with someone is not necessarily a close contact.	The North Dakota Department of Health will be conducting interviews with all persons diagnosed with COVID-19 to determine who their close contacts are.  People who are identified as close contacts will be notified by the North Dakota Department of Health and will receive instruction on quarantine and monitoring.	If you have not been contacted by the North Dakota Department of Health after you have been in the same location with a person diagnosed with COVID-19, you are not considered a close contact but should continue to follow social distancing guidance, good handwashing hygiene and staying home if you become sick.	Any person with a fever and/or respiratory symptoms who was not tested, should stay home until at least 3 days (72 hours) have passed since recovery (fever-free without the use of fever-reducing medications) and improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g, cough, shortness of breath); and at least 7 days have passed since symptoms first appeared.	How many positive cases (people diagnosed) of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been reported in North Dakota and where are the cases located?	For the most up-to-date information on the number and location of cases (people diagnosed) of COVID-19 reported in North Dakota, visit:	Is there any information about coronavirus (COVID-19) in languages other than English?	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website has information translated in Mandarin and Spanish:	The Minnesota Department of Health has information on coronavirus (COVID-19) in multiple languages (Amharic, Arabic, Chinese, Hmong, Karen, Russian, Somali, Spanish, and Vietnamese):	I'm older and have a chronic condition, although I feel fine right now.  I want to protect myself.  Should I be going to work?	It's important to discuss with your health care provider about your risk of complications if you would also acquire coronavirus (COVID-19).  Decisions between your health care provider and your employer could help you decide what is best for your health.	All people should continue to follow social distancing guidance, good handwashing hygiene and staying home if sick.  Any person with a fever and/or respiratory symptoms who was not tested, should stay home until at least 3 days (72 hours) have passed since recovery (fever-free without the use of fever-reducing medications) and improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g, cough, shortness of breath); and at least 7 days have passed since symptoms first appeared.	I am an employer, for what reasons should I close my business?	Interim guidance for businesses and employers can be found at:	I am an employer and am wondering how to handle employees who state they tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19).  How can I verify if this is true?	The North Dakota Department of Health cannot release an individual's test results to unauthorized persons because of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Laws.  However, we will work with individuals to identify any close contacts that need to be notified.	I have been around someone at work who was identified as a contact to some diagnosed with coronavirus (COVID-19).  What should I do?	Secondary contacts (contact to a contact) can report to work as long as they are not sick.  Unless you have been told to stay home by the North Dakota Department of Health, you can report to work as long as you remain well.	All people should continue to follow social distancing guidance, good handwashing hygiene and staying home if sick.  Any person with a fever and/or respiratory symptoms who was not tested, should stay home until at least 3 days (72 hours) have passed since recovery (fever-free without the use of fever-reducing medications) and improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g, cough, shortness of breath); and at least 7 days have passed since symptoms first appeared.	I have been sick and now I'm feeling better, but my employer wants me to get tested for coronavirus (COVID-19) or get a note from my health care provider before I come back to work.  What should I do?	All people should continue to follow social distancing guidance, good handwashing hygiene and staying home if sick.  Any person with a fever and/or respiratory symptoms who was not tested, should stay home until at least 3 days (72 hours) have passed since recovery (fever-free without the use of fever-reducing medications) and improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g, cough, shortness of breath); and at least 7 days have passed since symptoms first appeared.	Guidance for employers on response plans to COVID-19 can be found at:	Someone who lives in my home is sick with respiratory symptoms but has not been tested for coronavirus (COVID-19).  I am not sick, can I still work?	Yes, people who are not sick and are not under advisement for other reasons (e.g, travel from a Level 3 location, close contact to a person diagnosed with COVID-19) can report to work.	All people should continue to follow social distancing guidance, good handwashing hygiene and staying home if sick.  Any person with a fever and/or respiratory symptoms who was not tested, should stay home until at least 3 days (72 hours) have passed since recovery (fever-free without the use of fever-reducing medications) and improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g, cough, shortness of breath); and at least 7 days have passed since symptoms first appeared.	Where can I find a list of agencies with significant changes to their work hours or closures?		FirstLink is maintaining a list of agencies with significant changes or closures across the state on their website.  This list will be updated in real-time as such information is shared with them.	Where can I find information/resources for businesses and employers?	Resources for businesses and employers can be found at:	Where can I find information/resources for childcare/daycare facilities?	The guidance for schools and daycares can be found at:	There was a webcast on March 10, 2020, that discussed questions that many childcare/daycares have relating to coronavirus (COVID-19).  That webcast can be found at:	While recommendations around social distancing and mass gatherings indicate people should not congregate in groups of 10 people or more, this does not apply to the school, work, business owners or childcare settings at this time.	I have an international trip planned.  Should I still travel?	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued travel warnings related to all international travel.  Some countries have more strict recommendations than others.  For up-to-date information related to travel warnings and recommendations, visit:	I recently traveled within the last 14 days.  I'm not sure if I was somewhere with coronavirus (COVID-19).  What should I do?	All individuals traveling back to North Dakota from international locations and states in the U.S that have been classified as having widespread disease by the CDC (list below) must quarantine immediately upon reentry to the state of North Dakota and for a period of 14 days.	Essential critical infrastructure workers, as defined by the United States Department of Homeland Security, are exempt from this order.	Affected individuals are encouraged to fill out the travel form to receive information on how to monitor for symptoms.  If you have symptoms and wish to seek medical care, please call before you go in.	Should I travel within the United States?	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not generally issue advisories or restrictions for travel within the United States.

See the Travel Quarantine Order for more information, including a list of affected states.	I received an offer of mortgage or rent assistance; how do I know if it is legitimate?	While some offers of assistance are legitimate, many are not.  Some red flags include:	Guarantees that a business can stop a foreclosure or eviction, regardless of circumstances.	Asking for payment before any services are performed.	Instructions to make mortgage or rent payment to someone else, not to your loan servicer or landlord.	Asking you to sign incomplete or blank paperwork or pressuring you to sign a document you have not had time to read thoroughly.	Do not respond to emails, texts or social media notifications that you can receive or are qualified for assistance.  Call your mortgage servicer or landlord to discuss your situation.	I heard there was a 60-day mortarium on foreclosures and evictions, do I have to make my payment?	Yes, if you can pay your rent or make your mortgage payment, you should continue to do so.  The moratorium on foreclosures and evictions doesn't mean that payments are no longer required.  It means that households who are unable to make payments cannot be evicted or foreclosed on.	My friend doesn't have to make his payment, he received a payment holiday.  Why didn't I receive a holiday?	A payment holiday doesn't mean that your friend won't have to make a payment, it means the payment was deferred or delayed.  Eventually, the payment will be required.  Each mortgage loan servicer or landlord has different financial circumstances dictating what they are able to offer.  Talk to your loan servicer or landlord to learn what options they can provide.	If I can't pay my rent, will I be evicted?  If I can't make my mortgage payment, will I lose my house to foreclosure?	Contact your landlord or mortgage servicer to discuss the situation.  It will be up to your landlord or mortgage servicer to decide if they will offer a repayment plan and/or waive late fees.	I was laid off and can't make my mortgage or rent payment, what should I do?	Contact your mortgage servicer or landlord to discuss your situation.  Servicers provide their contact information on monthly statements or in a payment coupon book.  Landlords provide contact information on leases.  It is typically available at apartment building entrances as well.	Additional information from the North Dakota Department of Human Services North Dakotans are encouraged to use the North Dakota Department of Human Services self-service portal at to apply for Medicaid health care coverage and other help, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), child care assistance and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).
