Kids are not waiting at bus stops, the line at your favorite coffee spot is much shorter.  This week Governor Stitt ordered all non-essential businesses be closed in Oklahoma counties with confirmed COVID-19 cases for the next 21 days.	You may be asking yourself, what now?  How do I manage my day-to-day with these types of closures?  What exactly can I expect?		:Non-essential businesses are those providing items or services that are socially driven.  Think gyms, bars and other similar businesses and services.	Grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations and other services Oklahomans depend on to care for themselves and others are open, and you can find a full list of essential services here.	Check your favorite grocery store's website before you head out for a gallon of milk or a couple rolls of toilet paper; many have reduced hours or are offering specific hours for members of our communities who are at higher risk.	If your ability to work will be impacted by these new restrictions, there are resources to help you.  Check out Oklahoma Works for additional information on how to file an unemployment claim or access resources for alternate employment during this time.	We know it's a lot to ask, especially if you are feeling well.  Maybe, it's starting to feel like you're listening to a broken record, and well, you are.  Just know these restrictions are being implemented after careful consideration, informed by science and facts.	Stay home, slow the spread, and protect our Oklahoma communities.
