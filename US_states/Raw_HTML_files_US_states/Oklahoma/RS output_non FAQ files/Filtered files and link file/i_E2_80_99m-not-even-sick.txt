We understand and want to stress that this is not about YOU.	It is about your grandparents.	It is about your aunt with high blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes.	It is about the volunteers in the nursery at your place of worship.	It is about the hourly workers still making your coffee.	It is about the healthcare workers who continue to put themselves in harm's way.	We are asking all of our Oklahomans to be good neighbors.	Limit your time out and about in the community to just the essentials.	Observe social distancing guidelines.  If you are waiting in line to pick up necessities at the grocery store, or need to pay for gas at the gas station, keep your distance from the next person in line, or ask the person behind you to take a few steps back if you need to.	Practice good personal hygiene.  Any time you interact with members outside of your own household, remember to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer when you return home.	Pay attention to your surroundings.  Are you in a crowded room with elderly?  Is it hard to walk in between people to get to the counter?  If you or someone you love is at higher risk, remove yourself from that situation.	While data continues to become available to help medical experts understand how COVID-19 is being spread, we know our best weapon is personal responsibility.  Let's make future generations proud of how we worked together to mitigate a public health crisis.  Let's serve as leaders in responding with empathy, compassion and respect for our neighbors.
