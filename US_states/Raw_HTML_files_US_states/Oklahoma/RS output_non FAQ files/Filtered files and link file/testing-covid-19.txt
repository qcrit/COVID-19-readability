	Can you pass me a tissue?  What used to be a normal request this time of year is now one that can induce anxiety and fear.  We want you to know we understand why you might feel that way, and we appreciate steps you may be taking to help prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19.  But we also think it's important to stick to the facts --and we at the Oklahoma State Department of Health are focused on making sure you have them.	Welcome to the OSDH blog.  As we continue to learn more about the impact here in Oklahoma, we want to provide you with relevant information that can help you, your family, and those around you, do your part.	Let's start with some basics.	Who Can be Tested?	CDC guidelines for COVID-19 testing have required patients to have fever, cough, or respiratory symptoms, as well as evidence of direct or indirect contact such as travel to China or other affected countries, or close contact with someone who has tested positive.  Individuals are encouraged to contact their doctor or public health professional to seek guidance on whether they may be at risk of having COVID-19.	Who Should be Tested?	That depends.  It's tempting to make an appointment with your provider or rush to the nearest urgent care to be seen at the first sign of the sniffles.  We want to be healthy, and we want to protect ourselves and others from becoming sick.  The OSDH encourages you to work with your medical provider to determine your level of risk before deciding if you should be tested.  If you develop symptoms and are over 60 years of age, have a pre-existing chronic condition, are pregnant, or have a weakened immune system, you are at a higher risk.  Your medical provider can support you in determining the best treatment option.  If you don't have a regular medical provider, contact our COVID-19 Call Center here in Oklahoma at 877-215-8336 for guidance on how to proceed.
